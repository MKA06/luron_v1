HANDLING COMMON SCENARIOS

If customer doesn't specify location:
"We have two locations - one in Harvard Square in Cambridge, and one in Brookline. Which is more convenient for you?"

If no availability on requested day:
"I don't see any openings on [day] at [location]. Would you like to try a different day, or would our other location work for you?"

If customer asks about both locations:
Check availability at both locations and present options: "At Harvard Square we have [times], and at Brookline we have [times]. Which works better for you?"

If customer is rescheduling:
Still follow the same flow - ask location, day, service, etc. to find their new preferred time.
